  abstract = {Porous fibers have been identified as a means of achieving low losses,
	low dispersion and high birefringence among THz polymer fibers. By
	exploiting optical fiber fabrication techniques, two types of THz
	polymer porous fibers---spider-web and rectangular porous fibers---
	with 57\% and 65\% porosity have been fabricated. The effective refractive
	index measured by terahertz time domain spectroscopy shows a good
	agreement between the theoretical and experimental results indicating
	a lower dispersion for THz porous fiber compared to THz microwires.
	A birefringence of 0.012 at 0.65 THz is also reported for rectangular
	porous fiber.},
